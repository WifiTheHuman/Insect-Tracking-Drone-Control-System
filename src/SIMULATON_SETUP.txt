To setup the simulation environment, execute the following commands from the "Firmware" directory.

source Tools/setup_gazebo.bash $(pwd) $(pwd)/build/posix_sitl_default
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$(pwd):$(pwd)/Tools/sitl_gazebo

To launch the simulation, execute the following commands from the "Firmware" directory.
This launches the gazebo simulation with one "iris" (quad) drone and starts the px4 softawre.
The drone can be controlled using QGroundControl or MAVROS. The world used is a
modified empty world setup to use latitude and longitude as a reference frame.

roslaunch px4 mavros_posix_sitl.launch

QGroundControl can be launched at any time but it should now be able to connect to
the drone and control it. It can be downloaded at http://qgroundcontrol.com/downloads/

To control one drone using MAVROS and gps setpoints execute the following commands from the
"Firmware" directory. This will launch the drone and hover at 20 m, continually updating
the setpoint based on the position it recieves from a laptop over zmq. If the laptop stops
sending position updates, the program will timeout and the drone will land.

cd integrationtests/python_src/px4_it/mavros/
python mavros_offboard_posctl.py
